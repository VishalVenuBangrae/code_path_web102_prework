# WEB102 Prework - *Kraken Funders*

Submitted by: **Vishal Venu Bangrae**

**Kraken Funders** is a website for the company Sea Monster Crowdfunding that displays information about the games they have funded.

Time spent: **5** hours spent in total

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

* [x] The introduction section explains the background of the company and how many games remain unfunded.
* [x] The Stats section includes information about the total contributions and dollars raised as well as the top two most funded games.
* [x] The Our Games section initially displays all games funded by Sea Monster Crowdfunding
* [x] The Our Games section has three buttons that allow the user to display only unfunded games, only funded games, or all games.

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [x] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app functionality!
* Introduced our games tab on the navbar, so that the user can directly navigate to the Our Game section of the website
* Added a search bar on the nav bar, with a dropdown suggestion box, that displays all the suggested game as per the search. Once you click on any suggestion the website scrolls down to the particular game card selected, whcih is highlighted in yellow.
* Changed the CSS, for an overall more vibrant website

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
* Some of the challenges I faced were working with the suggestion box idea, and highlighting the game card upon selection of suggestion.
* I also corrected the issue with the our games navbar, where it was not displaying all games on initial click.
